WebKit-Fu

My leet WebKit skillz. Fear them mightily.

Recommended to only be run with an up-to-date version of WebKit (Chrome will do nicely).

Mouse Dialog
------------

An almost pitch-perfect implementation of Snow Leopard's Mouse Preferences, using nothing but HTML5, CSS and, y'know, _sheer awesome_.

Video is a screencapture of the one used in the actual Prefs, and therefore very probably copyrighted by Apple. In the (highly) unlikely event that someone should shake their legal fist at such _treacherous and blatant piracy_, I shall deem the world too depressingly banal and end it all.
